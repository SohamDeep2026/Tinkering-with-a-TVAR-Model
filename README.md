# Tinkering-with-a-TVAR-Model
This is my first try at creating a Time-varying autoregression model. I have generated random non-stationary time series, to which I have fitted a TVAR model to generate AR coefficients. I have then plotted these coefficients onto a heatmap, and analysed the heatmap to draw conclusions regarding the non-stationarity of the time series.
